Howard Glynn's post from May 22 is right on - if you're running Solaris 8, make sure you get the latest Recommended patch cluster. I've been struggling with that library problem that happens when you start Apache for several weeks, tweaking the config, setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. I couldn't believe that the PHP developers wouldn't have the Solaris build right - seems like a fairly important OS. But the latest Solaris patch cluster fixed the problem, so I guess it was my fault for not being up to date. I'm running PHP 4.2.1 now with Apache 2.0.36, works great.
