I've had a lot of problems with "dn_skipname" reference errors when trying to do a php / apache shared-library install on solaris 8. All compiling was clean, but could not restart apache with mod_php. After much trial and error, I found a solution by installing patch 109326-07 which has some fixes for resolver (I think). I had one web server without the patch, and one with it, and was able to show the same commands compiling, working and restarting on one, but not the other. Installed patch on machine, compiled clean and was up and running after doing this. Works great. Get the patch from sun.com
