PHP 4.1.1 / Apache 1.32 Buile Issues (Solaris 2.8)

Apache build options:
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/etc/apache --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite

PHP build options:
./configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/etc/mysql --with-apxs=/usr/local/etc/apache/bin/apxs

Both Apache and PHP compiled without errors and installed cleanly.

The Error when starting Apache:
Syntax error on line 208 of /usr/local/etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf:
Cannot load /usr/local/etc/apache/libexec/libphp4.so into server:
ld.so.1: /usr/local/etc/apache/bin/httpd: fatal: relocation error: file /usr/local/etc/apache/libexec/libphp4.so: symbol dn_skipname: referenced symbol not found ./apachectl start: httpd could not be started

Line 208 in the httpd.conf file is: 
LoadModule php4_module        libexec/libphp4.so

The solution:
For some reason, even though LD_LIBRARY_PATH was being set properly,
it wasn't being read fully.  You will need to create a runtime
linking environment by doing this:

#crle -c /var/ld/ld.config -l /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/etc/mysql/lib
