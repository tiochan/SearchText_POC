Re: where is ctid_t defined? (Solaris 10)
Author: Juergen.Keil         Nov 17, 2004 10:37 AM (reply 1 of 10)     
ctid_t is defined in /usr/include/sys/types.h ("typedef id_t ctid_t;").

I guess what has happend is that you're using a gcc compiler that
was build on Solaris 9 (or some other Solaris release older than
Solaris 10 b69), and this gcc release has a set of "fixed" gcc specific
headers that don't match your s10b69 system headers any more.

The fix is to build a fresh set of gcc "fixed" headers:

# cd /opt/sfw/gcc-3/lib/gcc-lib/i386-pc-solaris2.9/3.3.2/install-tools/ 

# cat > mkheaders.conf
SHELL=/bin/sh
SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR="/usr/include"
OTHER_FIXINCLUDES_DIRS=""
FIXPROTO_DEFINES="-D_XOPEN_SOURCE"
STMP_FIXPROTO="stmp-fixproto"
STMP_FIXINC="stmp-fixinc"
^D

# ./mkheaders
